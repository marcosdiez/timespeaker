TimeSpeaker
===========

Speaks the time every time you get your lock screen password wrong on Android.

This software actually improves my sleep. If, while sleeping (or almost waking up)
I open my eyes, than I get back can't to sleep. So I learned how to wake up and
keep my eyes closed. Apparently this is not hard, as I know other people who can do
it as well.

So I wake up and, with my eyes closed, grab my phone. Afterwards I turn the screen on,
which is easy because it is a hardware button. Then I just hover my finger randomly
at the screen, which should now be the lock screen.

Of course my password will be mistyped and that is when this software will just speak
out loud what time it is.

This way I know if I must wake up or if I can sleep for some more minutes.

----------

For this software to work you must set it as a device administrator.
That means you must unset it if you plan to uninstall it.
That is an Android idiosyncrasy in which I have nothing to do with.
Go to Settings / Security / Device Administrators to enable/disable it.
